# Code_Refactor

## Project Description:

I have been hired by a marketing agency to refactor an existing site. In this project, I have to clean up the semantics in the code, write comments for the html and css, add alt attributes to images, and fix any other bugs on the website. From this project, I learned to better use semantics, comment, organize code, and find bugs.

## User Stories Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
